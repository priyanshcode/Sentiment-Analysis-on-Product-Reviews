Sentiment analysis uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique for the detection and classification of sentiments in texts.. In this research paper various sentiments are there but this mainly focuses on three basic sentiments, Positive, negative and neutral. A crucial method for identifying and examining the attitudes represented within this enormous corpus of textual data is sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining. The proliferation of online shopping and digital platforms has spurred an explosion of freely accessible product reviews, offering real-time insights into consumer sentiments. This research utilizes a comprehensive dataset of product reviews from diverse online platforms. Each entry includes the review text, sentiment label, timestamp, user details, platform, and engagement metrics. This rich data is invaluable for studying sentiment dynamics in product consumption and understanding customer interactions with various product aspects and brand experiences. By analyzing this wealth of user-generated content, we aim to uncover the nuances of customer opinions and contribute to a deeper understanding of how consumers perceive and react to products in the digital marketplace. In order to create strong sentiment analysis frameworks that can capture the subtleties of user sentiments, we explore the landscape of sentiment analysis on social media platforms in this research paper by utilizing the capabilities of several well-known classifiers, such as Tf-IdfVectorizer, TextBlob,PassiveAggressiveClassifier,SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, RandomizedSearchCV, etc.
